# DAZ Visual Asset Browser (VAB)

VAB is a local REST API server that brings semantic search to your DAZ Studio content library. It indexes your installed products into a vector database and exposes a query interface so you can find assets by meaning rather than by name — "asian city streets", "soft fantasy lighting", "gritty cyberpunk outfit" — across your entire collection.

The server is the product. A web UI is included as a reference client and demonstration of what the API can do, but the API itself is the interface designed for integration, automation, and building your own tools on top of.

> [!NOTE]  
> The reference web UI uses the Script Server DAZ plugin to allow users to open the DAZ content manager to a product page in a running DAZ Studio directly from a search result. It's not strictly necessary for searching, but to get full benefit consider installing the plugin. It's free and available here: https://github.com/bluemoonfoundry/daz-script-server/releases/latest

---

## What it does

- **Semantic search** — query your library with natural language; results ranked by meaning, not keywords
- **Hybrid filtering** — combine a semantic query with hard filters on category, artist, and compatible figure
- **Full product index** — browsable paginated catalogue with sorting and filtering
- **DAZ Studio integration** — open products in the Content Library, load assets into scenes, and read content directories from a running DAZ Studio instance via the DAZ Script Server plugin
- **Full library coverage** — indexes Smart Content products *and* Content-Library-only content: third-party installs with no DAZ SKU, and files unzipped straight into a content directory with no CMS record
- **Incremental indexing** — tracks what's already indexed; re-runs only process new products
- **Demo mode** — runs with mock data and no database, useful for UI development and trying the interface
- **Web UI** — a reference browser client served at `/` when `ui/dist/` is present

---

## Installation

The software requires requires Python 3.11+ installed. No other setup. We are working on building out an installer that wraps the Python build explictly into a standalone executable. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are installing on MacOS, you'll have to remove or comment out the "onnxruntime-directml" dependency in the pyproject.toml file before you can run the installation step

## Option A -- Clone, venv, and run 

The simplest way to get this working in a development setup is to clone the repo, setup a virtual environment, and install the requirements, and run the server. Note that the PyTorch installation in this method needs to be done manually depending on your specific CUDA version. 

```
git clone https://github.com/bluemoonfoundry/daz-content-browser.git

python -m venv install .venv

source ./venv/Scripts/activate

pip install -e ".[local-llm]"

python vab.py server
```

## Option B -- Direct Run

1. Download `vab-release.zip` and unzip to a permanent location (e.g. `C:\Tools\VAB`).
2. Open a terminal in that folder and run the installer:
   ```bash
   python install.py
   ```
3. Once installation finishes, start the server:
   ```bash
   run.bat          # Windows
   ./run.sh         # Mac / Linux
   ```

   The run scripts support optional flags:
   - `--demo` - Run in demo mode (mock data, no database required)
   - `--dev-ui` - Run with Vite dev server for UI development (requires `ui/src/`)

   | Command | API Server | UI | Access URL |
   |---------|-----------|-----|------------|
   | `./run.sh` | Production | Pre-built | `http://localhost:8000` |
   | `./run.sh --demo` | Demo mode | Pre-built | `http://localhost:8000` |
   | `./run.sh --dev-ui` | Production | Vite (hot-reload) | `http://localhost:5173` |
   | `./run.sh --demo --dev-ui` | Demo mode | Vite (hot-reload) | `http://localhost:5173` |

   Interactive API docs are always available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`


---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **After installation, you need to index your content before the UI will display anything.**
> The server will run, but your library will be empty until you build the index. See [Production setup](#production-setup) below for configuration and indexing instructions. To try the UI immediately with mock data, use [Demo mode](#quick-start-demo-mode) instead.

---

## Quick start: Demo mode

Demo mode runs the server with built-in mock data. No database or configuration required — useful for trying the UI or developing against the API.

```bash
# From release zip
run.bat --demo        # Windows
./run.sh --demo       # Mac/Linux

# From source or pip
python vab.py server --demo
vab server --demo
```

Once started:
- **Web UI**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **API docs**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

---

## Production setup

### 1. Configure your environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DAZ_STUDIO_EXE_PATH` | Full path to `DAZStudio.exe` |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` | DAZ CMS PostgreSQL host and port (defaults: `127.0.0.1` / `17237`) |
| `DB_NAME` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASS` | DAZ CMS credentials |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL_DIR` | Local cache path for the ONNX model (default: `models/bge-large-en-v1.5/`) |
| `EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE` | Texts per ONNX inference call (default: `32`; lower = less memory) |

The DAZ CMS database is installed and managed by DAZ Studio — you do not need to set it up. Run DAZ Studio at least once before indexing.

### 2. Build the index

```bash
python vab.py load
```

Pulls products from the DAZ CMS database, scans the content directories for anything the CMS does not track, generates embeddings, and stores everything in the local SQLite + ChromaDB index. First run is slow (embedding generation); subsequent runs are incremental.

```bash
python vab.py load --force      # full rebuild from scratch
python vab.py load --limit 100  # process only 100 products (testing)
python vab.py load --phase etl  # CMS products only, skip scan and embedding
python vab.py load --phase scan # Content Library scan only
```

#### Smart Content vs Content Library

DAZ Studio's Smart Content pane is backed by the CMS database; the Content Library pane
is the raw folder tree of your content directories. VAB indexes both:

| Source | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `daz-store` | CMS products with a DAZ store SKU |
| `cms-local` | CMS products with no store SKU — Renderosity and other third-party installs |
| `filesystem` | Files found on disk with no CMS record at all, grouped into products by path |

Filesystem products get a synthetic `fs-…` SKU, a thumbnail taken from the PNG DAZ Studio
writes next to each asset, and a category/figure guess derived from their install path.
`GET /api/v1/info` reports the per-source breakdown under `products_by_source`.

Grouping filesystem content into products is heuristic — there is no product boundary on
disk, only naming conventions. To inspect and tune what the scanner would produce before
indexing:

```bash
python analyze_content_roots.py --show-dirs
```

Set `SCAN_MIN_PRODUCT_DEPTH` in `.env` (default 5) to control how aggressively sibling
directories are merged into a single product.

### 3. Start the server

```bash
python vab.py server
python vab.py server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```

---

## API reference

All endpoints are under `/api/v1/`. The server exposes interactive Swagger docs at `/docs` and ReDoc at `/redoc` — these are the authoritative reference for request/response schemas.

Base URL (default): `http://localhost:8000`

---

### Status & indexing

#### `GET /api/v1/status`

Health check and index counts. Polled frequently by the UI.

```json
// Response
{ "success": true, "message": "Opened 'Night Runner' via DAZ Script Server.", "via": "plugin" }
```

---

### Search

#### `POST /api/v1/search`

Semantic search with optional filters. Primary search endpoint for the UI.

```json
// Request body
{
  "query": "gritty cyberpunk street clothes",
  "filters": {
    "category": "People",
    "artist": "Daz Originals",
    "compatible_figures": "Genesis 9",
    "is_installed": true
  },
  "max_results": 500,
  "min_relevance": 0.0
}

// Response
{
  "results": [ /* product objects with relevance_score */ ],
  "total": 12,
  "query": "gritty cyberpunk street clothes",
  "took_ms": 84
}
```

All filter fields are optional. `max_results` caps how many results the server returns (default 500); pagination is handled client-side. `min_relevance` filters out results below a score threshold (0.0 = no filtering).

#### `POST /api/v1/query`

Full-featured semantic search with multi-value filters. Designed for programmatic and MCP use.

```json
// Request body
{
  "prompt": "elegant fantasy gown",
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0,
  "tags": ["fantasy", "gown"],
  "artists": ["Daz Originals"],
  "categories": ["Clothing"],
  "compatible_figures": ["Genesis 9"],
  "score_threshold": 1.0,
  "sort_by": "relevance",
  "sort_order": "descending"

```

All filter arrays are optional. `score_threshold` is the maximum distance score (lower = more similar; 1.0 returns all results).

---

### Filters

#### `GET /api/v1/filters`

All distinct filter values present in the index. Use this to populate filter UI dropdowns.

```json
{

Probe whether the DAZ Script Server plugin is running.

```json
{ "plugin_detected": true, "plugin_url": "http://localhost:18811", "version": "1.0" }
```

#### `GET /api/v1/daz-studio/content-dirs`

Returns the content library directories from the running DAZ Studio instance.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `refresh` | bool | false | Force re-query from DAZ Studio |

```json
{ "dirs": ["C:/Users/.../Documents/DAZ 3D/Studio/My Library", ...], "count": 3 }
```

#### `POST /api/v1/scene/load`

```

---

### Assets & files

#### `GET /api/v1/assets/{sku}`

Asset file records for a product with resolved absolute paths. Searches both PostgreSQL content roots and DAZ Script Server content directories to find files on disk.

```json
{
  "sku": "54841",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "/People/Genesis 8 Female/Clothing",
      "filename": "Night Runner Jacket.duf",
      "resolved_path": "C:/Users/.../My Library/People/Genesis 8 Female/Clothing/Night Runner Jacket.duf"
    }
  ]
}
```

`resolved_path` is `null` if the file cannot be found on disk.

#### `GET /api/v1/assets/thumbnail?path={path}`

Serve the companion thumbnail image for a DAZ asset file. DAZ Studio places thumbnails alongside content files with the same filename and a `.png` extension.

Returns the PNG directly, or `404` if no thumbnail exists.

#### `POST /api/v1/files/reveal`

Open the system file explorer with the given file selected (Windows Explorer, Finder, or `xdg-open`).

```json
// Request body
{ "path": "C:/Users/.../Night Runner Jacket.duf" }
```

---

### Info

#### `GET /api/v1/info`

Full database statistics including category, artist, and tag histograms. Expensive — intended for dashboards and MCP clients, not frequent polling.

#### `GET /api/v1/content-roots`

Content root directories from the DAZ CMS PostgreSQL database.

```json
{ "content_roots": ["C:/Users/.../Documents/DAZ 3D/Studio/My Library"] }
```

## Developer guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ (for the UI)
- Git with submodule support

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluemoonfoundry/daz-content-browser.git
cd daz-content-browser
make install            # Python deps + UI node modules (includes CPU-only torch)
make build              # build UI into ui/dist/
```

For development, you can run:

| Command | Mode | UI | Access URL |
|---------|------|-----|------------|
| `./run.sh` | Production | Pre-built from `ui/dist/` | `http://localhost:8000` |
| `./run.sh --demo` | Demo | Pre-built from `ui/dist/` | `http://localhost:8000` |
| `./run.sh --dev-ui` | Production | Vite with hot-reload | `http://localhost:5173` |
| `./run.sh --demo --dev-ui` | Demo | Vite with hot-reload | `http://localhost:5173` |

> Note: The `--dev-ui` flag requires the `ui/src/` submodule to be present. Without it, use the pre-built UI at `:8000`.

### Makefile targets

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `install` | Install Python deps (including CPU-only PyTorch) and UI node modules |
| `build` | Build the UI into `ui/dist/` |
| `dev-server` | Run the API server at `:8000` |
| `demo-server` | Run the server in demo mode |
| `dev-ui` | Run the Vite dev server at `:5173` |
| `test` | Run smoke tests |
| `sync-ui` | Pull latest UI submodule commits |
| `release-zip` | Build `dist/vab-release.zip` |
| `release-wheel` | Build pip-installable wheel into `dist/` |
| `release-exe` | Build standalone Windows executable via PyInstaller |
| `gh-release` | Publish `dist/` artifacts to a GitHub release |
| `clean` | Remove `ui/dist/`, `dist/`, `src/ui_dist/` |

### Building and publishing releases

```bash
make build           # required first — populates ui/dist/

make release-zip     # → dist/vab-release.zip
make release-wheel   # → dist/visual_asset_browser-*.whl
make release-exe     # → dist/vab/vab.exe

# Publish to GitHub Releases
make gh-release VERSION=v1.0.0 TITLE="Initial Release" NOTES="First public release"

# Update an existing release
make gh-release VERSION=v1.0.0 UPDATE=1 NOTES="Fixed wheel packaging"
```

`TITLE` defaults to `VERSION` if omitted. All `*.zip` and `*.whl` files in `dist/` are attached. The PyInstaller output directory (`dist/vab/`) is zipped automatically if present.
